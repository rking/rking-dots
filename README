= The Idea =

So I can sit down at an unconfigured machine, and run:

[[ !-d ~/src ]] && mkdir ~/src \
    cd $_ && git clone git@github.com:ryanjosephking/config.git && \
    make -C config

...then it will provide me with a decently synced config. Specifically, it's
all symlink-driven: on a given machine, I edit ~/.zaliases and it's really
editing ~/.zaliases .  This means that when I then do a `cd ~/src/config; git
commit ...; git push`, it will be available to all other machines as soon as I
`git pull` from their ~/src/config/. Most of the time I won't even have to do
a new `make` (unless I've added additional files).

At the moment, some of this is a bit crufty, but I plan on refining it
soonish. If I remember to remove this comment then it proves that I was
serious about this intention.

= Intertwinencies =

This stuff pretty much assumes the presence (and use) of:
    - zsh
    - vim
    - screen

Note that the X stuff comes along for the ride, but simply sits there and does
nothing on the machines it is irrelevant to.

= Per-host Config =

All machine-specific stuff can be driven by two scripts:
    ~/.localrc (sourced by .zshenv) - Good for setting variables that will
        then "talk" to the subsequent .zshenv, .zaliases, and .zshkeys

    ~/.afterlocalrc (sourced by .zshrc) - Good for overriding anything that
        would otherwise get clobbered by being set in ~/.localrc alone.

= .screenrc =

One kind of weird part is the generation of the ~/.screenrc's. This is
essentially so that I can set $SCREENESC and $SCREENCOLOR on a per-machine
basis. This is because when I'm on my desktop using ^a with green, then
connected to a DMZ machine using ^x with red, and finally a dev machine with
^j and blue -- they are all quickly identified and manipulated.

It's been a while since I looked at this, so perhaps there is a way to make it
work without the ~/.screenrc generation.

= Next Step =

A more complete solution would be more based on sets of configs. So, people
who use bash could get all the common stuff with people who use zsh, etc. I
haven't had this problem, yet, so I'm leaving it non-generalized. If you want
to be the second test case, I'd be happy to cook something up.

= Thanks =

...to COL Ingus for the original conception of the system.
